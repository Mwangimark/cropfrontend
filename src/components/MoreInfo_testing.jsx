//     details:
//       'Nitrogen (N) is a primary macronutrient crucial for healthy leaf and stem growth. It is a major component of chlorophyll, the compound plants use in photosynthesis to convert sunlight into energy. Adequate nitrogen results in lush, green foliage and vigorous vegetative growth. Deficiency often causes yellowing leaves (chlorosis) starting from older leaves.',

//     details:
//       'Phosphorus (P) is vital for energy transfer and storage in plants. It plays a key role in root development, flower formation, and fruit production. It supports cell division and helps plants mature properly. A phosphorus deficiency can cause stunted growth, delayed maturity, and purplish coloration on leaves, especially in young plants.',

//       'Potassium (K) regulates various physiological processes, including water uptake, enzyme activation, and photosynthesis. It strengthens plant cell walls, improves disease resistance, and enhances drought tolerance. Potassium is also crucial for improving the size, color, and taste of fruits and vegetables. Deficiency often shows as yellowing or scorching at leaf edges.',

//     details:
//       'Soil pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the soil and directly affects nutrient availability. Most crops thrive in slightly acidic to neutral soil (pH 6.0–7.0). If the pH is too low (acidic) or too high (alkaline), certain nutrients become locked in the soil and inaccessible to plants.',
